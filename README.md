# Facial-Expression-Recognition
This repository houses modules created for my dissertation on Facial Expression Recognition. The modules leverage Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) for Data Augmentation and Image Generation. Additionally, the repository includes associated scripts and Results.
